Harry Williams, of the r&b band, Bloodstone, is about to go onstage, when he's hit on the head. We follow his dream, as the other band members become conductors aboard a train filled with characters - from the 1930s, including W.C. Fields, Dracula, and Scarlett O'Hara. Various songs are featured. The singing conductors are obliged to solve a mystery; Marlon Brando's killing of Nelson Eddy, Jeanette McDonald and others. A wacky funeral, a fight with a gorilla, and the threat of being turned into a wax museum are all ahead.
