A financier agrees to take an ex to her business meeting. On the way, they run a stop sign in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and are arrested. But all is not as it seems: the courthouse and the "prison" are a maze of zany booby- traps and deadly contraptions. The antics of the captured couple as they try to escape from the mad judge and his bizarre family make up the rest of this unusual film.
