The lives of Geneviève Emery and Guy Foucher of Cherbourg, France are presented in 4 acts, in director Jacques Demy's fable of young love. The entire film is sung (It takes only a moment to get used to). This is really one of THE most gorgeous, unique films - the softly-hued pastels and vibrant solid (Eastman Colror) colours are used to help conversation, emotions and dramatise the story. Every time I've seen it with an audience, by the end, they're all sniffling, as tear falls. I'm willing to bet so will you. Watch this with someone special.
