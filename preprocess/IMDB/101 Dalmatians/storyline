After a wild chase in the bustling streets of London, struggling computer game author Roger (Jeff Daniels) and his male Dalmatian, Pongo - by a welcome twist of fate - are dragged into St. James Park and meet with charming fashion designer Anita (Joely Richardson) and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. Soon, one thing will lead to another, and before they know it, Roger and Anita will get married and the adorable Perdita, pregnant. However, their short-lived joy is disrupted when Anita's glamorous but horrible boss, Cruella DeVil (Glenn Close), dognaps the innocent puppies with the intention of making a luxurious coat with the dogs' fabulously spotted fur. Eventually, along with Perdita's fifteen puppies, Cruella will manage to bring the total to the staggering number of ninety-nine Dalmatians; nevertheless, are the cute little puppies as helpless as they look?
