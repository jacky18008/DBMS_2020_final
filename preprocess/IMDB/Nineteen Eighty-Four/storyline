Longing for freedom, a lowly, hapless Outer Circle bureaucrat of the Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith, summons up the courage to write down his unspoken desires in his little secret diary, in itself an illegal act. Serving silently at the pleasure of the grim, autocratic hyper-state of Oceania, Smith knows the INGSOC (English Socialist Party)'s supreme leader, the omnipotent Big Brother, watches his every move. As the permanent totalitarian government tightens its suffocating stranglehold more and more, Smith meets Julia, another rebel, and a dangerous clandestine affair begins. There's no turning back. Sooner or later, the illicit couple will have to pay as sex is meant for procreation only and deriving pleasure from it is also a crime, an intimate one often reported by one of the participants to the terrifying Thought Police. What makes a good citizen?
