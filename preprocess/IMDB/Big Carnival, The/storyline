CARNIVAL: The Movie is a documentary film focusing not only on the beauty of carnivals, the rides, the lights, etc., but also on all of the hard work that goes into setting up these small cities week after week, and the incredible amount of work that just goes into keeping the entire operation running smoothly to ensure that the attendees have a great time. Join us as we follow a family owned carnival company as they go on the road for the year.
