A werewolf, a vampire and a ghost live in a flat in Bristol. Where's the punchline right? Wrong. It's so much more complex than that and once you sit down and give it a chance, you'll see it was a great decision. This is one of the best shows to grace the airways. Everyone needs to give this a go. You won't regret it.
