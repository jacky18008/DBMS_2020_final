DI Frost is an old-school no-nonsense copper who believes in traditional policing methods. Frost uses what he knows about the street to find answers to crimes as a member of Denton's CID. His home life's complex, but his daily nemesis is the station's commander; Supt. Mullett, who's constantly worrying. He doesn't appreciate DI Frost's rough and ready manner, which doesn't stop him from trotting him out - with his George Cross,bestowed upon him.
