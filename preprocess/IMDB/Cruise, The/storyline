Always on the hunt for beautiful ladies, Gio loves to cruise past the avenue's regular joints in his black turbocharged Buick GNX, when, out of the blue, he spots an unknown sensual brunette who calls herself Francesca. And, just like that, a whirlwind summer romance starts to bloom, against the backdrop of catchy 80s freestyle music, youthful excitement, and an onslaught of contrasting emotions. Now, Gio feels ready to embrace the change; however, is this mysteriously alluring girl his soulmate? Can there be a future between the nice Jewish girl and the handsome bad boy from the other side of the tracks?
