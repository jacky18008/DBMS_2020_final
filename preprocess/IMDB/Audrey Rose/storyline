In New York City, Janice Templeton (Marsha Mason) is happily married to executive Bill Templeton (John Beck) and they live in a comfortable and fancy apartment with their eleven-year-old daughter Ivy (Susan Swift). One day, Janice is stalked by a weirdo and she tells her husband. Soon afterwards, the stranger contacts them and invites the couple to meet him in a restaurant. Elliot Hoover (Sir Anthony Hopkins) tells Janice and Bill that his daughter Audrey Rose died eleven years ago, burned in a car crash, and her soul has been reincarnated in Ivy's body. Bill and Janice believe that Elliot is nuts, and Bill tells his lawyer to get a restraining order against Elliot. However, Ivy has dreadful nightmares and only Elliot is able to calm her down. When Elliot abducts Ivy, Bill and Janice go to court to have him arrested. But Elliot wants to prove that Ivy and Audrey Rose are the same soul.
