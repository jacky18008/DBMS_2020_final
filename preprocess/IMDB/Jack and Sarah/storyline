Jack (Richard E. Grant) always lands on his feet. He lands on his feet when he marries the beautiful Sarah (Imogen Stubbs). He lands on his feet when he buys a luxurious new house. However, when Sarah goes into labor, he takes a tumble down the stairs and lands on his head. When he comes around, he discovers he is the proud father of a baby girl, but deficient in the spouse department to the tune of one. He hires the help of a novice nanny, but at the end of the day, it's Jack who's left holding the baby.
