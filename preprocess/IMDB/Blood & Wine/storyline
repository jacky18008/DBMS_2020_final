Cat Hogan is an isolated woman on the run from her past, a past she is forced to confront when the sudden 'accidental' death of her mother, Mary, draws her back to the family she has spent the last ten years trying to avoid. Although her death is seemingly 'accidental', Cat isn't convinced and suspects her father Jim (Adrian Dunbar) may have been involved in her untimely demise.
