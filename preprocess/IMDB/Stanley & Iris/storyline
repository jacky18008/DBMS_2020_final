Stanley is an imaginative and creative little boy who loves to make simple drawings of his favorite animals. His parents and his older brother can't see or hear the conversations he has with his talking pet goldfish, Dennis. As Stanley's closest adviser, Dennis serves as a guide who shows Stanley the life of animals through his "Big Book of Everything".
