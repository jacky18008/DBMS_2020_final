In 1831, Irishman Charles Adare (Michael Wilding) travels to Australia to start a new life with the help of his cousin, who has just been appointed Governor. When he arrives, he meets powerful landowner and ex-convict Sam Flusky (Joseph Cotten), who wants to do a business deal with him. While attending a dinner party at Flusky's house, Charles meets Flusky's wife Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), whom he had known as a child back in Ireland. Henrietta is an alcoholic, and seems to be on the verge of madness.
