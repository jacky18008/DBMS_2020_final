We're in a hip apartment in Montreal, on a hot summer night. A group of friends gather around a table, and play a sensual game involving chocolate and French kissing. We learn that Edward and Michael are long time friends, but Michael has a chip on his shoulder. When it's Michael's turn to sample the chocolate game, his girlfriend Teegan dares Alex, Edward's lover, to kiss Michael. Michael realizes that his sexual uncertainty may now be more than just a passing phase. As the night goes on, after many drinks and some weed, laughter, bonding, and dancing, the dawn slowly approaches, and Michael and Edward reminisce on their lives. Michael reveals what's troubling him, and confesses he felt something when Alex kissed him. Unbeknownst to them, Alex heard their conversation, and enables a threesome, that ends up with the whole gang together. What will the morning after hold?
