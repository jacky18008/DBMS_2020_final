The sultan is grooming Aladdin as new vizier, future son-in-law and heir to the throne of Agrabah, stirring palatial unrest. Former vizier-usurper Jafar was banished to a genie lamp, but is dug up by ambitious simpleton crook Abis Mal, whom Jafar manages to manipulate his three wishes so he can regain his power and return to Agrabah for revenge. His egotistic formerly trusted parrot Iago has already managed to cash in on the palace's gratitude, but is facing conflicting loyalties when his former master reveals himself to him. Genie is finally back and must take on a magic duel against Jafar, whose dirty tricks land Aladdin and Jasmine in the dungeons.
