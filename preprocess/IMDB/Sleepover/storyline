On the last day of 8th grade before their freshman year in high school, Julie has a slumber party with three best friends: Hannah, Farrah, and Yancy; and they have the time of their lives. To win the legendary high-school lunch spot by the fountain, they must win an all-night scavenger hunt against their popular-girl rivals. Unfortunately, Julie's mom has firm rules about the party. First rule: Don't leave the house. But Julie and her friends won't let a little thing like parental authority stand in the way of social domination, and they sneak out of the house, steal a car, snatch a cute boy's boxer shorts, crash a high-school dance, and torment an egomaniac security guard. Aong the way, some of the girls might just find love. Because anything is possible at Julie's sleepover.
