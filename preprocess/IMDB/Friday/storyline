It is Friday and Craig Jones (Ice Cube) is unemployed, having been fired yesterday. This has lead to trouble with Smokey's (Chris Tucker's) supplier, Big Worm (Faizon Love), who now wants his money, or his product back, or Smokey is a dead man. Then there's Deebo (Tommy "Tiny" Lister, Jr.), the local bully, plus Craig's jealous, psychotic girlfriend, Joi (Paula Jai Parker), and Debbie (Nia Long), the neighbor Craig has a crush on. A lot can happen while lounging around your house on a Friday.
