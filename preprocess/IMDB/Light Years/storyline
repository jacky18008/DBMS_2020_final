15-year-old foster-care vet Lux has finally decided to become an emancipated minor. During her journey through the legal maze, she finds her biological father, 32-year-old Nate "Baze" Bazile, who lives above a bar and is astonished to learn that he has a daughter, and finally her biological mother, Cate Cassidy, a local-radio star with a fiancé, Ryan Thomas. A judge decides to grant temporary custody of Lux to Baze and Cate instead of emancipating her.
