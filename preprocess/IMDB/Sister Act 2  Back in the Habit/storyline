The sisters come back to Deloris' (Whoopi Goldberg's) show to get her back as Sister Mary Clarence to teach music to a group of students in their parochial school, which is doomed for closure. One of the girls, Rita Watson (Lauryn Hill), who is the most talented of the bunch, is forbidden to sing by her mother, Florence Watson (Sheryl Lee Ralph), although the choir has made it to the state championship. A group of monks tries to stop them.
