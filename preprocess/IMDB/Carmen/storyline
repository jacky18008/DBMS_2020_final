Based on the novel by Prosper Merimee, CARMEN is the classic tale of forbidden passion between a young man (Leonardo Sbaraglia) and a spoken-for woman, Carmen (Paz Vega). It is told in flashback as the young soldier, stripped of his decorations, explains all in a prison cell. He tells of the love he had for Carmen and how it proved to be destructive.
