Mr. Magoo is an eccentric millionaire with terrible eyesight who refuses to use eyeglasses, therefore he always gets into trouble. During a museum robbery he accidentally gets a priceless gem called the Star of Kurdistan and starts to trace the way for the arch-criminals--Austin Cloquet and Ortega "The Piranha" Peru-- who had wanted to steal it. Meanwhile, two federal agents, Stupak and Anders, lead the manhunt for Mr. Magoo himself.
