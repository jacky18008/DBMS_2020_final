In a daring attempt to start afresh after a dead-end marriage, the successful book editor, Carly Norris, moves into her elegant new apartment on the twentieth floor of a high-tech Manhattan apartment building. Unbeknownst to her that the luxurious "sliver" building comes with a terrible history of unsolved grisly murders, Carly catches the eye of both the burned-out crime novelist, Jack Landsford, and the shyly charming video-game designer, Zeke Hawkins. However, as a mysterious voyeur watches the tenants' every move, yet another female neighbour dies. Could Norris be next?
