All his life, plucky parrotfish Alex has dreamed of being a superhero. He gets his chance when a mysterious flood of black goop erupts near his coral reef. As Alex and his pals-a seahorse, an eel, and a blowfish-swim off to confront the menace and save their home, they face a sunken ship with hidden treasure, an abandoned airplane, angry sharks, and an undersea volcano. This thrilling, funny family tale stars Mark Hamill (Star Wars), iJustine ("The Annoying Orange") and Ron Perlman (Hellboy).
