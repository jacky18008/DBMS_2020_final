About to stay a summer internship, promising young medical student at MIT, Raymond's mother, Susan, breaks her leg. Housebound and immobile, his father, Tom, makes Raymond stay home and take care of her. Susan's a troubled woman, and along with Raymond's own emotional strains, it leads them to intimate physical contact, which Raymond finds uneasy. He soon meets a high school girl, Toni, but his ability to handle starting a relationship with her is difficult, due to the emotionally troubling recent events in his life.
