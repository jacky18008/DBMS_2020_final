Louisa Atherton (Kerry Armstrong) is 49-years-old and to date has lived a privileged and superficial life. When her wealthy husband Jack drops dead in the arms of another woman, Louisa thinks things can't get worse - until she discovers that he's left her bankrupt. Louisa is forced to go back to her tiny home town, Rainbow's End, with her tail between her legs. As she re-negotiates her relationships with her prickly mother Minna (Julia Blake) and recalcitrant kids, she learns to understand herself for the first time in her life. Louisa also comes to realise that her small town's history will play a vital role in her future.
