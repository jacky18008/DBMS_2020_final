Montreal, Canada. A down-on-his luck dentist, "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry), discovers that his new neighbor is Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), former mob-contract-killer-turned-police-informant upon whose head the Hungarian mob has put a steep price. Egged on my his loathsome wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), Oz sets off to Chicago to let the mob know where The Tulip is and hopefully claim part of the reward.
