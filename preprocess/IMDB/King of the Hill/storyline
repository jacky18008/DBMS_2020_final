This show was another animation hit for Beavis and Butt-Head (1993) Creator Mike Judge, who also voiced the starring character Hank Hill, a propane gas salesman in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas. Hank was often besieged by the idiosyncrasies of society, but he found some serenity in his home life with his wife, substitute Spanish teacher Peggy, his awkward son Bobby, and his live-in niece-in-law Luanne Platter. Adding flavor to the ordinary dish the series served, were Hank's friends, divorcé military barber Bill Dauterive, paranoid Dale Gribble (with an obsession with Government conspiracy theories), and gibberish spouting Boomhauer.
