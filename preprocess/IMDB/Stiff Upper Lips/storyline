Young upper-class fellow Edward (Samuel West) arrives with his friend Cedric Trilling (Robert Portal) at the family manse, Ivory Hall. He plans to pair off Cedric with his sister Emily (Georgina Cates). Emily, on the other hand, falls in love with a son of local peasant, George (Sean Pertwee). Old Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales) sends all the bunch off, first to Italy and then to India, so Emily would forget George, who is an undesirable partner for her because of class differences, and choose Cedric.
