It's 22 years later. And Norman Bates is coming home. After being judged as "legally sane" in a court of law, Norman Bates is released from a mental institution, against the protests of Lila Loomis (the sister of Marion Crane). Upon his return to his home (and the motel which lays in its shadow) Norman strikes up a friendship with Mary, a waitress at a local diner. Just as he tries to adjust back to normality, the murders around the site of the Bates Motel. Has Mrs. Bates returned to pull Norman's strings again, or is the bloodbath someone else's handy work?
