A madcap portrayal of William Lightbody's (Matthew Broderick's) stay at the health farm run by cereal King Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (Sir Anthony Hopkins). William's wife, Eleanor (Bridget Fonda), has persuaded him to go to Kellogg to have his system cleaned of impurities. Kellogg is very unconventional, and almost barbaric in his treatments.
