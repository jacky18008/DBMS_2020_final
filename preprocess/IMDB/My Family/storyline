This is a long-running British sitcom that ran from 2000 to 2011. The sitcom centers around the dysfunctional Harper family and its members: Ben Harper (Robert Lindsay), a dentist who is stupid and clueless, who annoys his wife, and reluctantly loves his wife and kids. Susan Harper (Zoë Wanamaker) is a tour guide and a bad cook. Nick Harper (Kris Marshall) is silly and irritating, and Ben despises him. Janey Harper (Daniela Denby-Ashe) is a shopaholic, is sexually promiscuous, and is dismayed by Ben. Michael (Gabriel Thomson), Ben and Susan's geeky and highly intelligent youngest son, and has a dark, cynical sense of humor.
